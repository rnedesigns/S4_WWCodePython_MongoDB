# S4_WWCodePython_MongoDB

**MongoDB session with Python:**

**Tools & Language:** MongoDB Community Server, MongoDB Compass (GUI for MongoDB database), Python and Jupyter Notebook

This session covers the beginner level to interact with NoSQL (MongoDB) database and concepts. Prerequisites are to keep the MongoDB and Notebook servers turned on and demo walks through the code to learn about CRUD operations with MongoDB and Python, as these are main operations widely used for real-world applications such as content management systems, products data management systems, web applications and so on.

**The download resources for the above tools and language are:**
> MongoDB Community Server - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

> MongoDB Compass - https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass

> Python3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

> Jupyter Notebook - $ pip3 install notebook 

**To watch and read:**
> You can watch the [Video on MongoDB database + Python3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ggwv9IPNGk) - I have done the code demo to demonstrate interaction with MongoDB database with Python3 via Jupyter Notebook and IDE (VS Code I have used here)

> In this article, I have articulated it in bit more detail with the code snippets: [MongoDB with Python3](https://ramya-n.medium.com/mongodb-nosql-and-python-25b4956a591)

**Note**: Other tools can also be used to work with MongoDB database are: MongoDB Atlas and Mongo Shell, which are explained at high level.
